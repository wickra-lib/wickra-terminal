"""Assert that the R binding can link against the C ABI its version names.

Every other binding ships its native code in the same artifact as its wrapper,
so the two can never disagree. R is the exception: `bindings/r/configure`
downloads a prebuilt `wickra-terminal-c-<triple>.tar.gz` from the GitHub release named by
`DESCRIPTION: Version`, and compiles the generated `src/wickra_terminal.c` against it. The
wrapper comes from the working tree; the ABI comes from a published release.

Our own CI never sees that pairing, because the R job sets
WKTERM_INC/WKTERM_LIB and builds against the header and library in
the tree, which match by construction. r-universe does see it, and went red for
the first time on 2026-08-25: 177 symbols the generated wrapper calls were added
to the C ABI after v0.9.9, and one export had gained a second
parameter, so the source build failed with 354 compile errors that all had one
cause.

That skew is not a defect -- the wrapper is correct against the ABI in the tree,
and a release republishes both together -- but it is invisible until r-universe
reports it days later. This makes it visible in the pull request that opens it.

Two claims, only one of them blocking:

  * Every `wickra_*` symbol the wrapper calls must exist, with the same
    signature, in the header in this tree. A violation means the generated
    wrapper is stale, which is a defect and fails.
  * The same, against the header at the tag `DESCRIPTION: Version` names. A
    violation means main is ahead of the last release and r-universe stays red
    until the next one. That is a release-readiness signal, not a defect, so it
    warns.
